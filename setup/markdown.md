# Creating your first markdown file

## Create a journal folder

In your home folder or your Documents folder, create a folder named `journal`.

## Write to a new file

Launch VS Code and type the following *exactly* as you see it here, but where you see `[Today's date]` insert the actual date for today (in any format you like). Don't include the brackets (`[ ]`).

```
# [Today's date]

## Things I Learned Today

### Markdown

Wow! This is my *very first* markdown file!

I'm impressed with myself for **these reasons**:

- I've learned something new
- I'm on my to becoming a [digital humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities)
```

## Save the file

Save the file, naming it `journal_yyyy-mm-dd.md`. (Replace the y's, m's, and d's with the numbers for today's date, e.g. `2020-01-27`.) **Be sure to include the `.md` file extension**.

When you saved the file, how did the file contents' appearance change in VS Code?

## Add an image to your file

- Inside your `journal` folder create another folder named `images`
- Click the link in your markdown file to the Wikipedia page on "Digital Humanities"
- Click on the screengrab of textual analysis of Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* in the upper right of the page
- Click the "More details button" in the next window
- Click the "Download" button to the right of the image in the page named "File:Pride and Prejudice in Voyant Tools.png"
- Download the "Full resolution" version of the image and move it to the `images` folder in your `journal` folder
- In your markdown file, type `![](images/Pride_and_Prejudice_in_Voyant_Tools.png)`

What have you just done? To find out, click the "Open Preview to the Side" button in VS Code. It looks like this:

## Explore the files in this module

Scroll up to the top of this page and click on the button that says "Raw". Do the same on the page for the [syllabus](../syllabus_s20.md). What do you see?

## Question

In the module files' image links, why do you find `../images/` rather than `images/` ?
