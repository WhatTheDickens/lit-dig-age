# ENGL 340 S20 Information and Schedule, COVID-19 EDITION

*This is the revised syllabus for our class effective March 23. You can always find the original syllabus, for comparison, on [GitHub](https://github.com/WhatTheDickens/lit-dig-age/blob/master/syllabus_s20.md).*

*Our individual and community learning outcomes haven't changed. Nor have our means of assessment (blog posts, annotations on* Walden, *journaling, and a final project.) But some readings have been eliminated, and the final project **may** become an individual rather than a group project.*

*In comparing this syllabus with the original, please note especially the revisions to the section titled [Take care of yourself](#take-care-of-yourself) and to everything after [spring break](##week-9-|-soft-restart).*

## Individual learning outcomes

What will you know and be able to do as a result of taking this course? First, because this is a 300-level English course, you’ll improve your

- ability to read texts in relation to history
- understanding of how texts are related to social and cultural categories (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, ability), enterprises (e.g. philosophy, science, politics), and institutions (e.g., of religion, of education)
- understanding of how language as a system and linguistic change over time inform literature as aesthetic object, expressive medium, and social document

In addition, as a result of taking ENGL 340, you should

- understand, at a basic level, the computational dimension of language and literature
- understand, at a basic level, some common uses of computation and computational tools in the study of literature
- feel prepared to use computational methods and tools for literary analysis and interpretation in another literature course
- know more about how your computer works than you did before

## Community learning outcomes

What will we accomplish in this course as a community?

- Produce new knowledge (new for this community) about literature and literary study in the digital age
- Share knowledge about literature and literary study in the digital age in accordance with scholarly conventions
- Discuss and debate ideas about individual literary works and about the nature of literature and literary criticism in ways that respect the diversity of the community
- Help one another when we’re stuck

## Assessment

How will you know if you’ve met the individual outcomes? How will we know if we’ve met the community outcomes?

- You’ll keep a journal in which you write regularly about what you’re learning in the course
- You’ll write two blog posts for this website in which you reflect on your learning in this course
- You’ll contribute to a final project in which you make use of particular computing skills that you acquire in the course

## Texts

- James Gleick, *The Information*
- Jeffrey Pomerantz, *Metadata*
- Henry D. Thoreau, [*Walden*](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/walden/) and *Selections from the Journal*
- Assorted short readings

## Tools and accounts

- **Blog**: You’ll earn up to **30** points for two blog posts (15 points each) in which you reflect on your learning in this course. (Due 2/12 and 4/15.)
- **Blog some more (optional)**: You can earn up to **5** points for up to 5 additional blog posts over the course of the semester. Posts must be directly relevant to our work in the course. Each post will be evaluated based on relevance, quality of writing, and content. You can post to the blog as often as you like, but you can’t earn points for more than one extra-credit post in any given week of the semester.

## Do you have a disability?

SUNY Geneseo will make reasonable accommodations for persons with documented physical, emotional or learning disabilities. Accommodations will be made for medical conditions related to pregnancy or parenting. Requests for accommodations including letters or review of existing accommodations should be directed to the [Office of Disability Services](http://www.geneseo.edu/dean_office/disability_services) in Erwin 22 (Ms. Heather Packer, disabilityservices-at-geneseo.edu or 585-245-5112). If you have an accommodation letter, let me know as soon as possible in the semester so we can discuss specific arrangements.

## Take care of yourself

It’s hard work being a student! You can improve your chances of success by eating well, getting enough sleep, and making wise choices. **If you need help, ask for it.** [Student Health and Counseling](https://www.geneseo.edu/health) can help you if you’re sick or need psychological or emotional support. A variety of [Campus Learning Centers](https://www.geneseo.edu/library/center-academic-excellence), including the [Writing Learning Center](https://www.geneseo.edu/english/writing_center), offer academic support services. **And then there’s me.** [Schedule an appointment](http://schacht.youcanbook.me) to consult with me about assignments, to tell me if you’re facing basic obstacles to success such as food insecurity, to continue the conversation about readings and topics in the course, or just to talk. If reading or discussing certain kinds of content in this course might prove traumatic for you, let me know and we’ll work together to figure out a reasonable solution.

**COVID-19 Addendum**: Everything in the paragraph above is all the more important in our new reality. Your top priority for the remainder of the semester should be to *stay healthy* and to look after the health of those in your immediate community, whether that's family or friends. You should know that I'm looking for you to make your *best effort* with the assignments that remain. If you're in touch with me in a timely fashion (preferably via Slack, but other means are fine), I'm happy to be flexible about due dates. Our aim for the remainder of the semester is to *keep learning*. In every piece of assigned work that remains this semester, then, the question you should be asking yourself is, "Am I showing that I've learned something?" 

## Think about others

- Express yourself honestly but respectfully
- Practice [forbearance](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forbearance) when offended by others, even as you exercise your right to explain your reasons for taking offense
- Consider how the world looks to someone who is not you
- Do your best to address others as they prefer to be addressed

## Week 9 | Soft restart

### Office hours, journaling

I'll hold drop-in office hours Monday and Wednesday 12:30 pm - 2:00 pm. I'll use Zoom for this rather than Google Hangouts because Zoom will do better at accommodating a large meeting. Watch for a link to come your way in Slack and via Google Calendar. I'll answer any questions you have about how we're going to preserve learning in our class for the remainder of the semester and help you troubleshoot any computer issues you may be having.

*You should continue journaling and pushing your journal files to GitHub — twice a week — this week and throughout the remainder of the semester. These files, as always, needn't have a lot in them. They should, at a minimum, chronicle the things you're learning in the course.*

### Other assignments for the week

- Read *The Information*, Chapter 14 - Epilogue
- Read [*Walden*](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/walden/), “The Ponds” through "Winter Animals."
- By Thursday at 11:59 p.m.: 
	- Leave a comment on any passage in these chapters of *Walden* that has to do with *time*.
	- Leave a comment on any passage in these chapters that connects with your experience in our current unprecedented circumstances. 

## Weeks 10-12 | Metareading

See the modules I've built in Canvas (when published). The modules cover topics that we would have covered differently in our face-to-face meetings. Same content, new approach. No added assignments. Some assignments from the original syllabus have been eliminated to simplify your life. You'll find the specific assignments and due dates in the modules themselves.

In brief, the modules cover: 

- "Metareading" as a type of reading that we should consider alongside "close reading," "hyperreading," and "machine reading" (aka "distant reading")
- The concept of a "fluid text"
- *Walden* as a fluid text
- TimelineJS as a tool for metareading a fluid text
- TEI/XML as a tool for metareading a fluid text 
- The concept of "metadata"

Principal readings contained in these modules:

- [*Walden*](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/walden/), "The Pond in Winter" through "Conclusion"
- Robert Sattelmeyer, "The Re-making of *Walden*"
- [Introduction to *Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](http://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/)
- "Examples for Module 7: Critical Editing" in [TEI by example](https://teibyexample.org/examples/TBED07v00.htm)
- Emily Dickinson, "Faith is a fine example" on the [Versioning Machine](http://v-machine.org/samples/) website
- Jeffrey Pomerantz, *Metadata*

**Due by April 13:** Your journal to date  
**Due by April 15:** Your second blog post

During this period I'll continue to hold drop-in office hours MW 12:30 pm - 2:00 pm and to remain available by appointment. However, if not many people drop in for office hours, we'll rely entirely on appointments.

## Weeks 13-15 | Projects

See the module I've built in Canvas (when published). During these three weeks, you'll create a timeline using TimelineJS that explains your view of what is happening in some change or set of changes Thoreau made to *Wadlen* as he drafted the work.

You'll also pick a single manuscript page that has changes on it and encode these changes in XML/TEI.

On our original syllabus, these were to be group projects. Working in groups may be difficult in our new circumstances, so it's possible these will become individual projects. We have some time to negotiate this.

During this period I'll continue to hold drop-in office hours MW 12:30 pm - 2:00 pm and to remain available by appointment. However, if not many people drop in for office hours, we'll rely entirely on appointments.

**Your timeline, XML/TEI file, and blog post discussing your project are due on Wednesday, May 6.**
