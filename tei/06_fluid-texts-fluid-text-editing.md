# 6. Fluid texts and fluid text editing

This section will introduce you to the concept of a “fluid text,” using *Walden* and *Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition* as examples.

## What is a fluid text?

In *The Fluid Text: A Theory of Revision and Editing for Book and Screen* (1988), the Melville scholar John Bryant explores the implications of regarding all literary texts as inherently fluid. A work of literature doesn’t spring fully formed from its author’s mind but is rather the product of multiple revisions. Some of these revisions reflect changes in the author’s overall conception of the work — their evolving sense of the work’s general purpose and organization. Others reflect the author’s efforts to fine-tune particular words and phrases. Some revisions originate from sources other than the author: for example, an editor or publisher. Once a work is published, it may undergo further revision in subsequent editions — again, sometimes reflecting authorial decisions and sometimes editorial ones. Finally, works that capture the reading public’s imagination typically find themselves re-made in multiple ways across multiple media. Think, for example, of the many derivative works that have developed out of Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*, Lewis Carroll’s *Alice* books, or Jane Austen’s novels — not to mention the plays of Shakespeare.

It would be a mistake, Bryant argues, to suppose that any one moment in a work’s history of development represents “the work” plain and simple. A moment’s reflection on our own writing process will tell us that even the last version of a text fixed in print with the author’s approval contains many sites where the author, less than fully satisfied with the words on the page (or the screen), might, given the opportunity, gladly revise another time.

Rather than think of a literary work as a fixed and stable object, then, we might better understand it is an ongoing project. Bryant invites us to think here of the two different ways that we use *work* in ordinary conversation. We can talk about *a work*, meaning the final product of some type of labor. But we can also talk about *the work* that goes into making this product.

Our whole view of literature shifts when we focus less on *works* on more on *work*: on the energy that flows through texts, bringing them to life and giving them an afterlife in the many derivative texts that flow from them.

## *Walden* as a fluid text

Although Bryant encourages us to think of all texts as fluid, he concedes that some texts “reveal their fluidities more or less fully than others.” A text’s pre-publication fluidity is most evident when there is a manuscript or typescript that bears witness to authorial changes, as is the case with Henry David Thoreau’s *Walden*.

Thoreau began writing *Walden* while living at the pond (1845-1847), incorporating passages from his Journal that date as far back as 1840. He likely returned to the manuscript in 1848-49, producing second and third versions. By February, 1849 he was in correspondence with the publisher W.D. Ticknor about publishing both *Walden* and *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers*, his memoir of a river trip with his late brother John. Ultimately, it was James Munroe who published *A Week* in 1849, with an advertisement in its pages for the forthcoming *Walden*. But when *A Week* failed to sell more than about 200 copies, Thoreau put publication of *Walden* on hold. He returned to the manuscript in early 1852, and in the course of 1852-54 he made additional changes in fourth, fifth, and sixth versions that more or less doubled its length. In early 1854 he made a seventh set of revisions, then presumably sent an eighth and final copy of the manuscript (now lost) to Ticknor and Fields before the end of March. *Walden* was published in April, 1854.

The Huntington Library in San Marino, California holds the manuscript of *Walden*, which amounts to 1200 handwritten pages. With support from a State University of New York grant awarded to the [Digital Thoreau](https://digitalthoreau.org) initiative at SUNY Geneseo, the library has digitized the manuscript, which you’ll find [here](https://cdm16003.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16003coll16).

How should Thoreau’s revisions to *Walden* affect our understanding of the book? This is a question that scholars have been asking since J. Lyndon Shanley first determined that the sprawling manuscript represents seven distinct stages of revision. He offered his own answers in his 1957 book *The Making of* Walden. Other assessments have followed: *Revising Mythologies: The Composition of Thoreau’s Major Works* (1988), by Stephen Adams and Donald J. Ross, Jr., is particularly useful, as is Robert Sattelmeyer’s concise analysis in “The Re-making of *Walden*” (1990).

## Creating a fluid-text edition of *Walden*

To find our own answers to this question, we need tools to help us navigate *Walden*’s fluidity.

In 1967, Ronald Clapper, then a graduate student at UCLA, produced such a tool as his doctoral dissertation. *The Development of* Walden: *A Genetic Text* printed the 1854 edition of *Walden* from the first word to the last, adding a footnote at every point of variation among the seven versions to catalog how each manuscript “witness” read at that point.

Based on Clapper’s dissertation, [Digital Thoreau](https://digitalthoreau.org) produced a “fluid-text edition” of *Walden* by encoding the manuscript witnesses in [XML/TEI](https://tei-c.org).

An open-source application called [The Versioning Machine](http://v-machine.org) transforms the TEI-encoded text into HTML for the web, enabling a reader to compare the points of variation between manuscript versions side by side.
