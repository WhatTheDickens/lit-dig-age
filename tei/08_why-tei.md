# Why TEI?

You came here (if you’ve been reading the module pages in order) from a page that ended with the words, “We’ll consider those questions on the next page.”

Of course, you’re not looking at a page. You’re looking at a screen. (Unless you’ve printed the screen contents to paper. But why would you?) So you didn’t go to the *next* anything. You stayed right where you were, looking at the same two-dimensional surface. The word *page* in this context is a hold-over from an older vocabulary belonging to a different reading experience in which you do, in fact, advance from one two-dimensional surface to another. It belongs to the vocabulary that was being discussed a moment ago, when there were different words on your screen: words like *title*, *line*, and *stanza*.

The human mind is very adept at understanding terms flexibly, adjusting how a term is understood to fit the circumstances. You’re fine with “next page” sometimes meaning “really, next page” and sometimes meaning “a new set of words on your screen,” and you know when you’re dealing with each.

Computers aren’t so good at this.

If we want to describe what’s happening in a text so that a computer can understand what we’ve said, we need a precise metalanguage and we need to use it with consistency. TEI meets these needs.
