# 15. Final project instructions

Your final assignment in ENGL 340 is a group project. It has **one main goal and three parts**.

The **main goal** is to bring together a few of the most important skills you’ve developed in this class in order to help you think about Henry David Thoreau as a writer and share your thoughts with a wider audience.

The **three parts** are

1.  A **timeline** that your project group will create to provide a visual explanation of some revision or series of related revisions in *Walden* that your group finds interesting. The timeline will consist of manuscript images accompanied by explanatory text, as in [the example, shared earlier, of Thoreau’s revisions to the title page of *Walden*](http://bit.ly/2HdlcP6). The revision(s) must involve changes *across* two or more of Thoreau’s draft versions, not simply to a single passage on a single page. Your explanation must be an attempt to relate the changes you see to something larger that should interest us about *Walden*. Again, the example shared earlier offers a model in its attempt to understand the specific changes in question to Thoreau’s larger project of managing the risk of appearing egotistical in a work that, to do its job, has to be about himself. You’ll embed your timeline in the blog post described in (3), below.
2.  A **TEI encoding** of *one page* from the series of pages your group includes in the timeline. (The number in the series will depend on the revision\[s\] your group chooses to focus on in the project. It could be as few as two.) Your group will collaborate on the TEI file and share it with me using GitHub. (More details to come on this.)
3.  A **blog post** in which your group presents its perspective on the revisions you’ve visualized and discusses the process of creating the timeline and the encoding, including challenges and obstacles the group overcame (or couldn’t overcome). One group member will post on behalf of the whole group.

## Method of work

Each group will work in a dedicated Slack channel. You’ll do all your intra-group communicating about the project in this channel. *Please don’t use other methods of communication for this purpose,* such as GroupMe or email. One reason for using Slack is that I can see your communications, intervene if I see an opportunity to be helpful, and answer any questions you may want to ask there. Another is that your communications in Slack constitute evidence of your ongoing engagement with the project and of individual group members’ contributions.

Any shared documents you create (e.g., your timeline spreadsheet, a shared file for your encoding) should also be shared with me.

## Checkpoints

Use your group's dedicated Slack channel to share the following information and documents with me by the date indicated:

-   **By May 1** (11:59 pm): The revision(s) in the *Walden* manuscript that your group has chosen to work on, together with a brief explanation of why you've made that choice.
-   **By May 4** (11:59 pm): A link to the Google sheet that will be generating your timeline.
-   **By May 7** (11:59 pm): A draft of your TEI file. This must be a plain text file, written in VS Code, with the extension `.xml`. Don't attempt to create this file using Google docs.
-   **By May 11** (11:59 pm): A draft of your timeline and a second draft of your TEI file if necessary.
-   **By May 13** (12 noon): Completed timeline, completed TEI file pushed to GitHub (details to come on how you'll push the file), published blog post at <https://dh.sunygeneseoenglish.org>

## Due date

Your timeline, blog post, and TEI file area all **due by noon on May 13**.

## A few words about your TimelineJS timeline

The example timeline discussing Thoreau's epigraph to *Walden* incorporates HTML and CSS in the spreadsheet cells in order to provide a transcription that indicates the rough positioning of some of Thoreau's cancellations and insertions. For example,

> In most lectures <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">or</span> <sup>and</sup> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">stories</span><sub>Books</sub> the I, or first person is omitted

You're welcome to try this approach in your own timeline, ***but it's not necessary***. It's fine simply to describe what you see happening on the page.

If you're interested in examining the HTML that's been used in the example, you can do so by poking around in [this copy of the sheet being used to generate the timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12-TCyXGYSGMW3rkBHtflWMZZAZM2Qybz05xStLcf9hM/edit?usp=sharing). You'll find the marked-up explanatory text in the "Text" column of the spreadsheet.

The example also frequently incorporates a link in the "Media Caption" column to where a user can inspect the manuscript images in the Huntington Library's viewing tool. Since you don't have those links, you might consider using your caption to link to the IIIF image that you've put into the the "Media" column. However, ***this, too, is entirely optional***. You can put a descriptive caption in each row of this column that's just text with no link.

## Evaluation

As with past assignments, I’ll share a Google form I’ll be using to ask myself questions about the completed project as a whole and each individual’s contributions to it. The project as a whole can earn up to 20 points for each contributing member. In addition, members can earn up to 15 points for their individual contributions.
