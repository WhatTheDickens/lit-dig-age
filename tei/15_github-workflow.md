# GitHub workflow for TEI project

As explained on the previous page for this module, you'll collaborate on the TEI file for your final project, and share the completed file with me, using GitHub. Here's how that will work.

## GitHub project repository

I've created a repository in my own GitHub account to be "project central" for this assignment. It's named [lit-dig-age-proj](https://github.com/WhatTheDickens/lit-dig-age-proj).

The repository has a folder for each project group. The folder names track with the names of your dedicated project-group Slack channels:

-   proj-1
-   proj-2
-   proj-3
-   proj-4
-   proj-5
-   proj-6

Each repository contains a template file to get you started. It's similar to the template file you used for the [Edit your own TEI file](https://canvas.geneseo.edu/courses/17027/assignments/122569 "Edit your own TEI file") exercise in the previous module. You can adapt this file for your team's TEI project.

Distributed collaboration is one of the reasons-for-being of Git (the versioning software you run from your command line) and GitHub (the website for storing Git repositories). Every member of your group can make a copy of the TEI file, work on it individually, and push changes up to your team's folder . (You won't want to make changes to the contents of other teams' folders.) 

This is a very different collaboration model than, say, Google docs. You're not all working simultaneously in one file. Instead, each of you has a copy of the file, and the one in the GitHub repository represents the file's leading-edge state. Whenever there's a new commit, it comes, as you know from working in your journal repositories, with a comment briefly explaining the changes. In addition, you can compare any two states of the file to see exactly what's changed. And it's always possible to roll back to an earlier version. This is the same workflow that software developers use to develop code collaboratively.

It's up to your group to decide how you want to divide up the work of developing your file. You might find it easiest to assign different parts of the file to different individuals, so that you don't find yourselves pushing changes that duplicate or override changes pushed by others in the group. But at the end of the day, it's up to you to decide, as a group, what works best for you.

## Fork - Clone - Push - Pull

The repository has a "how-to page" that explains what each group member has to do in order to make the above workflow possible. Briefly, each of you will *fork* the repository in my account, creating your own copy of the repository in your own account.  You'll then *clone* your fork to your own machine, so you can work on it locally. After making edits, you'll *commit* your changes and *push* them up to your own account, just as you've been doing with journal files.

But then you'll do something new. You'll open a *pull request* to copy the changes you made to your fork over to the "project central" repository in my account. I'll review your pull request, and if all looks good, I'll *merge* it into the project-central repository.

Again, this is a brief overview. The "how-to" page has all the details. And if you run into any difficulties, you know, of course, where to get help.

I'll use the state of the TEI file in your group's project folder in the project-central repository as of 12 noon on May 13 as the basis for my evaluation of this part of your final project.
