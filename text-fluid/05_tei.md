## Introduction to text-encoding

The previous module introduced the concept of *metareading* as a type of reading that makes claims about a text *as* text. Although not the same as *close reading*, which focuses on generating intepretations of a text through attention to patterns (of words, imagery, narrative elements, character, etc.), metareading certainly requires close attention to detail. And because declarations about a text as text require judgment and are always subject to debate, metareading is, in its own way, interpretive.

We've also seen that metareading and close reading are not only similar but frequently intertwined. Especially in the case of fluid-text editing, everything we say about the text as text has potential consequences for how we interpret its meaning.

### Metareading and metadata

There are many different ways to make declarative statements about a text. We can take a page from the manuscript of *Walden* and write a paragraph or an essay describing what we believe to be happening on the page. We can also use a tool such as TimelineJS to take a more visual approach, putting images of the manuscript beside a running description of Thoreau's revisions.

For the digital humanist, the most flexible, comprehensive, thorough, and useful way to make statements about a text is to make these statements right inside the text using a language specially designed for the purpose.

Terms for describing the parts of texts and the types of words used in them have been around for a long time. Books typically have *titles*, and these often appear on a *title page*. Longer books are frequently divided into *chapters*; chapters generally begin with *chapter titles* and may contain *chapter headings* and *subheadings*.
