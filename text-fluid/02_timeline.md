# Using TimelineJS to model revisions in *Walden*

This page and the following two will explain how you can use [TimelineJS](), an open-source tool for creating interactive timelines, to build your own narratives about Thoreau's revisions to *Walden*. First, we'll introduce the tool, and you'll practice using it by building a simple timeline based on some of what you've read in Gleick's *The Information*. Next, you'll learn how to work with the images in the Huntington Library's digitized *Walden* manuscript. 
Finally, you'll learn how to bring those images into a timeline that tells a story about a particular revision.
